# Welcome to the NETWAYS Open Source Community!

## WHO WE ARE & WHAT WE DO

NETWAYS has been simplifying open source infrastructure since 1995. Our comprehensive range of products and solutions are tailored to meet the needs of all sizes businesses and industries, covering setup, monitoring, automation, management, and hosting of open-source IT infrastructure. We organize events such as [OSMC](https://osmc.de) and [stackconf](https://stackconf.eu/), where like-minded individuals come together to exchange knowledge and have a great time! At NETWAYS, we are committed to sharing our expertise and delivering exceptional services.

As active contributors to the open source community, we prioritize collaboration and continuous improvement.

## LET'S EXCHANGE IDEAS!

Open source is at the heart of our daily work. As active contributors to the open source community, we highly appreciate community involvement in our projects! Our aim is to showcase our open source work and make our results, or even partial results, readily accessible to everyone. To achieve this, we utilize GitHub as a platform to push code, openly document our development process, and share valuable resources such as Ansible and Puppet Code, Prometheus Exporters, Icinga Check Plugins, and Code from our Trainings. We want to ensure that the tools we develop continue to address your needs and solve your problems effectively. With this in mind, we invite you to submit “pull requests” to develop, modify and expand our projects. We welcome your suggestions, experiences, ideas and appreciate your active involvement!

Please note that all participation is governed by our [code of conduct](https://www.netways.de/en/code-of-conduct/).
